Instructions

Welcome to The Resistance: Avalon, a game of hidden loyalties. 

To begin, select the number of players about to embark on quests. 

Input the names of all players in the order of which you are sitting.

The game will randomly assign players to the Good Team or the Evil Team. Tap the screen to reveal each individual role. Keep your role secret from the other players (have other players close their eyes)

If the game reveals that you are evil, it will also reveal the names of the other evil player(s).

A player will be selected to be the quest leader. The leader selects the appropriate number of players to participate in a quest.

Players tell the quest leader if they accept or reject the team. Majority rules the vote. If you are on the Good Team and suspect the team will fail the quest due to being evil, you should reject it. If you are evil and your evil teammates have been selected for the quest, you should accept it.

If the team is rejected, a new leader will be selected to put forth a new team. Be careful: if there are 5 teams rejected throughout the duration of the game, the evil team automatically wins.

If the team is accepted, the players participating in the quest pass the device to choose to pass or fail the quest. Good players must pass. Evil players may strategically choose to pass or fail. 

See if the quest passes or fails! If there is at least one fail (some quests require two fails), this is a point for the evil team. If everyone passes the quest, this is a point for the good team.

Progress through the various quests and the first team to receive 3 points wins!
